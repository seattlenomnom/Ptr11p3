/* README  for ptr11p3
*  Ptr11p3 is a test mule to demonstrate the interaction of a list head with
*  a previouly written function. A list head will allow insertEntry() to place
*  an entry anyplace in the linked list.
*
*  listHead is an instance of struct entry. Got the program to work correctly.
*  Somewhere I read that list head could be just a pointer to a struct entry.
*  But that would the logic of insertEntry less general.
*
*  Look at the possiblity of listHead being just a pointer to n1. Where did I
*  read that? Art of Programming and singly linked lists? The graphics program
*  that I wrote on the Quadra 650 (MPW, ResEdit, Jasik Debugger).
*
*  I wrote this with paper, pencil, eraser. It takes some time, but introduces
*  fewer bugs to find. I simplified the problem without changing the problem.
*  I spent time understanding the problem.
